= CodeBuild =

== Purpose ==
    * Fully managed build service
    * Compile & Run unit tests
    * Eliminates the need to provision and manage your own build servers
    * Provides pre-packaged environments for popular programming languages
    * Can customize build environments in CodeBuild to use your own build tools
    * Scales automatically

== Resources ==

== Concepts ==

=== How CodeBuild Works ===
    * Provide codebuild with a build project. Build projects contain:
        - the location of the source code
        - which build environment to use. A build environment represents:
            * Operating system
            * Programming language runtime
            * build tools
        - which commands to run
        - where to store the output
    * Codebuild creates the build environment from the build project specs
    * Codebuild downloads the source into the build environment & uses the buildspec
        - Buildspecs are in yaml format
    * Any build output is uploaded to an S3 bucket
        - Can also perform any tasks specified in the buildspec such as notifications
    * Logs output to CodeBuild and CloudWatch logs
    * Can use console, cli, or sdks to get summarized build information from codebuild while running
        - If using CodePipeline you can get limited build information from there as well

== Planning A Build ==
    * Repository Providers
        - CodeCommit
        - S3
        - GitHub
        - BitBucket
    * Build Commands
        - Commands & command order
        - Defined in buildspec
    * Runtimes and Tooling
        - Runtime requirements
        - build tool requirements
    * Additional resource requirements
        - IAM policies and roles to allow codebuild to access other AWS resources
    * VPC Constraints
        - VPC configuration
